*Replicating Results*

| To replicate the results from the paper, simply run the `DSFinal_Gao.do` file with the corresponding `DSFinal_Gao.dta` dataset in Stata.
| This includes the baseline 2SLS and OLS regressions, as well as the results from the staggered difference-in-difference event study.
| By removing the Pension part from the regression and running it again, you can obtain all the results shown in Table 2 of my paper.
